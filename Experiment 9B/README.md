# ToDoListSQLite (Expo)

This is a minimal Expo React Native project that demonstrates a ToDo list using **expo-sqlite** for local storage.

How to run:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```
2. Start the Expo dev server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
3. Open on a simulator or real device using the Expo Go app.

Files included:
- App.js — main app UI and logic
- src/database.js — SQLite helper functions
- package.json, app.json, assets placeholders

Notes:
- This is a minimal template. If you want a full generated expo project with example assets, tell me and I can expand it.
